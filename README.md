# Pig Game 🎲🐷

In this dice game two players take turns rolling a dice, with their scores tracked using variables: currentScore holds points earned during the current turn, and scores stores each player’s total points, accessed using the activePlayer variable that shows whose turn it is (0 or 1). When a player rolls the dice, a random number from 1 to 6 is generated and displayed as a dice image. If the roll isn’t 1, the number adds to the current turn’s score dynamically. If it is 1, the player loses the points earned in that turn, and the turn immediately switches to the other player — this means the activePlayer variable changes to the other player’s index, the current score resets to zero, and the UI updates to highlight the new active player by toggling special CSS classes that visually show whose turn it is. When the player clicks “Hold,” their current turn’s points are added to their total score using activePlayer to update the correct player’s score display dynamically also. After holding, the turn switches to the other player, resetting the current score and updating the UI again. The game stops when a player reaches 100 or more points: the dice image hides, the winner’s panel is visually highlighted, and a playing flag is set to false to prevent any further dice rolls or holds. Until the game is reset with the “New Game” button, which clears all scores, resets the UI, and sets playing back to true, no more actions are possible.
